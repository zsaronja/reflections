What happens when you initialize a repository? Why do you need to do it?
Files required to track files and changes are created, effectively creating staging area and repository.
I need it to use the functionality that versioning system provides.

How is the staging area different from the working directory and the repository?
What value do you think it offers?
It contains files that are prepared to go to repository.
It enables creating a set of files for commiting to repository so commits would be logically connected.
It enables us to choose which of the (modified) files will be sent to repository and which wil stay in working directory.

How can you use the staging area to make sure you have one commit per logical
change?

What are some situations when branches would be helpful in keeping your history

the diagram the way we do?

What are the pros and cons of Git's automatic merging vs. always doing merges
