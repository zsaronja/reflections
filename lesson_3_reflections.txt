When would you want to use a remote repository rather than keeping all your work local?
I need to use a remote repository when:
a) I am working with a team and need to share my files and changes with the team
b) when I am working on multiple computers and need a way to track changes on all of them
c) when I need to have a copy of all commits for backup purposes

Why might you want to always pull changes manually rather than having Git
automatically stay up-to-date with your remote repository?
