When would you want to use a remote repository rather than keeping all your work local?

I need to use a remote repository when:
a) I am working with a team and need to share my files and changes with the team
b) when I am working on multiple computers and need a way to track changes on all of them
c) when I need to have a copy of all commits for backup purposes


Why might you want to always pull changes manually rather than having Git
automatically stay up-to-date with your remote repository?

By pulling changes manually I stay in control of the code that I have in various branches.
When I pull changes I get informed what has been done with the code
If git pulls changes automatically I might be unaware of the changes that were introduced.
Also there is possibility of a conflict between changes which have to be resolved manually and 
I want to do that at my own convenience and not when GIT does the auto update.
 
 
Describe the differences between forks, clones, and branches.  When would you
use one instead of another?

Branch is a version of my project (a copy of certain commit with its history) copied in 
the repository in order to contain changes that I do not want to mix with the main code at the time.
Clone is a copy of the whole repository to my local computer.
Fork is a copy of another repository on GitHub which is simmilar to clone, 
but contains more information about its source.


What is the benefit of having a copy of the last known state of the remote
stored locally?
